# Cosmodrome-Installer

This is a simple script that installs Artix Linux and Cosmodrome.
Any customization is to be done by modifying the script itself. Once launched, the script will not prompt the user for info.

# Installation

In the OpenRC variant of the Artix Linux iso, run the following as root:

```
git clone https://github.com/theknighthades/cosmodrome-installer
cd cosmodrome-installer/
sh cosmodrome-installer.sh
```

# Future Developments

I am considering porting the script to other init systems, but it's not important as of now.
